<h2>About KNN Algorithm</h2>
<br>
<h3>K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on Supervised Learning technique. K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories. K-NN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is used for the Classification problems.</h3>
